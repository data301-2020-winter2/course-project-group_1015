 ## Research questions:

**1. BMI of Gender in relation to Tobacco Users
 
   After finding that there are more male smokers than female smokers, and visualizing each gender's BMI via a histogram; it is shown that females have less BMI than males. Therefore, as smoking decreases health the BMI rate also decreases.
 
 **2. Medical charges of Tobacco Users in relation to Age  
 
   In regards to the medical charges, in Johnny's EDA it is shown that as age increases for a tobacco user so does their medical charges. This can be explain as smoking can cause various harms to the body. Furthermore, we can approximate that since there are more male smokers, the medical charges of males are higher than females. 

 **3. For what BMI has the most Medical Costs?**
    The most expensive medical charges are between BMI 30-40 as seen in the graph, but the highest medical cost charged was for the person with a BMI of approx 48. This concludes that in USA obese people end up paying more for their medical costs irrespective of other factors included.
    From the analysis we also concluded that people with BMI between 30-40 are tobacco users which might play a factor in increased medical charges.
 **4. Is there a relation between Medical costs, Age, gender and number of children?**
    From the analysis, we concluded that Medical costs are generally higher for people of age above 50. Younger people have less medical costs as compared to older people.There was no specific relation found between gender and medical costs. 
    However, it was seen that having more children doesnt imply more costs as all the people with more than four children have costs under 10000 regardless of their age.
