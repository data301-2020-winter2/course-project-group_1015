 ## Research questions:
 **1. Male and female smokers with their medical charges at different age groups
 *2. Medical charges of smokers in relation with children
 **3. For what BMI has the most Medical Costs?**
      The most expensive medical charges are between BMI 30-40 as seen in the graph, but the highest medical cost charged was for the person with a BMI       of approx 48. This concludes that in USA obese people end up paying more for their medical costs ireespective of other factors included.
      From the analysis we also concluded that people with BMI between 30-40 are tobacco users which might play a factor in increased medical charges.
 **4. Is there a relation between Medical costs, Age, gender and number of children?**
      From the analysis, we concluded that Medical costs are generally higher for people of age above 50. Younger people have less medical costs as           compared to older people.There was no specific relation found between gender and medical costs. 
      However, it was seen that having more children doesnt imply more costs as all the people with more than four children have costs under 10000           regardless of their age.
