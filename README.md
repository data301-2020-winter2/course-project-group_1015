Medical Insurance is a safety net for people's emergency conditions. It helps to pay medicall bills which most people cant afford otherwise. Medical Cost in U.S are very high dependinng on various external factors such as population. In order to study these factors which results in high medical bills in U.S our team decided to choose a dataset related to this cause. With the help of the dataset, we can answer some major questions we are curious about like, which region has the highest medical cost, does the region with most oldest popultion has the highest cost and the relation between other factors (BMI, age, gender) and the medical cost. When comes to evaluating medical insurance costs, U.S lags behind other countries despite having a high medical cost all over the country. High medical costs already hace a lot of pressure on the current situation.United States's rising health care cost will definitely impact the nations economic life.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
The Medical Cost Personal Dataset provided by the book, Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz, obtained from Kaggle explains medical insurance cost based on the features of U.S. citizens. This dataset provides probing information in regards to the United States of America's, arguably inefficient, medical insurance products, namely age, sex, body mass index, children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges. By filtering the dataset in a systematic non-biased fashion, politicians and healthcare analysts will be granted an accurate representation of the allocation of funds within medical insurance products. Furthermore, any identified correlations can lead to implementation of laws that optimize the significant portion of taxes paid on the healthcare system in the US. This outcome will contextualize healthcare costs for the lay consumer, especially so for the recipients of extensive care covered by government funds. Lastly, this dataset can be the basis of a user-facing dashboard and other consumer-friendly tools for ease of access and reference.
