## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Healthcare cost remains a significant part of government budgets in US and Canada. It is often a center of debate in presidential elections and discourse in legislature circles, especially in recent years surrounding ObamaCare and now BidenCare. In order to create a policy that takes into account the demographics of the population and charge fairly, it becomes essential to identify trends in the data and stratify the population's risk factors for significant illness and subsequent cost based on their current wellbeing. For example, age can be used as a predictor of cost. In the event of a political deadlock, the data can also reduce misinformation and create some context for the US consumer in comprehending the makeup of their charges and fees. In essence, our interest lies in outlining direct correlations between demographic statistics identified in our population, namely age, sex, body mass index, children, smoking status and region, and cost on the healthcare system.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
The Medical Cost Personal Dataset provided by the book, Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz, obtained from Kaggle explains medical insurance cost based on the features of U.S. citizens. This dataset provides probing information in regards to the United States of America's, arguably inefficient, medical insurance products, namely age, sex, body mass index, children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges. By filtering the dataset in a systematic non-biased fashion, politicians and healthcare analysts will be granted an accurate representation of the allocation of funds within medical insurance products. Furthermore, any identified correlations can lead to implementation of laws that optimize the significant portion of taxes paid on the healthcare system in the US. This outcome will contextualize healthcare costs for the lay consumer, especially so for the recipients of extensive care covered by government funds. Lastly, this dataset can be the basis of a user-facing dashboard and other consumer-friendly tools for ease of access and reference.
