This probing in regards to The United States Of America's inefficient medical insurance products, which this dataset has a defying content of the age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region, and charges; therefore, filtering the dataset in a non-bias artificial intelligence table will grant an accurate idea for the medical insurance product. Furthermore, a correlation between age/BMI, charges/children, or a smoker can lead to a conclusion regarding the dataset. After filtering the dataset; the conclusion on The United States Of America’s medical insurance policy and product are set for better efficiency to suit the U.S. citizens. This outcome will help society understand the transparency of the medical insurance product to further better their lives and help medical insurance companies with the cost. Lastly, building a user-facing dashboard is an optimal analysis to further understand the “why” of the dataset.
